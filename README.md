# Life-Expectancy-Paper
<h1>The importance of life expectancy comes from the fact that there is no better indicator of a country’s socio-economic development than having a long and healthy life.

The specific problem we choose to solve is Predicting life expectancy in different countries using the ‘Random Forest Regression Model’.
<h1>
<h2>We have investigated multiple models from different research papers on the topic of life expectancy to find the best way to build a model.
 
These models also helped us understand what components we need to mainly consider and make sure never gets omitted.

They also showed us what different methods we can use and how you can combine multiple regression models and what are the things we must be caution with and what are the things we can relax on.
